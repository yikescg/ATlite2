"ResetInstructionsLong", <<******
The powers on this character are broken rather badly. You will need to reset them to fix the character.
Before resetting the character, you should alert the player of the ramifications of this
procedure. They are outlined below in a form which you can send directly to the player.
*******
We have found that the powers on your character are broken. We are unable to
make a minor fix and restore your character. We can reset all your powers
and allow you to choose them again, though. Resetting your powers does
several things:

1. All your existing powers will be removed.
2. You keep all your experience points, but your security level will be
	dropped back to level 1. You will then need to go to a trainer and level
	back up to your current level, selecting new powers and assigning enhancement
	slots like you usually do.
3. You will lose all of the enhancements which are currently slotted into
	your powers, but you get influence in return for losing these enhancements.
	For each enhancement, you will get enough influence to buy the same
	enhancement back from a store. After you train back up to your level, you
	will need to visit the appropriate stores to buy these back.
4. Missions, contacts, Super Group, and all other settings should be unchanged by this process.

Are you sure that you want to do this?
**************
Once you have sent the information above to Cryptic (VERY IMPORTANT) and
the player has verified that they wish to reset their character, you may follow the procedure below.
"This procedure will clear their powers and reset the character to their first level (though they keep
all their XP). They will lose all enhancements slotted in their powers. They will get influence for
them so they can buy them from the store again.

In brief:
1. First, copy the diagnostic information shown above and get it to Cryptic, along with the character and server name.
2. Cash in their enhancements, reset all their powers, and drop them to level 1.>>
"ResetInstructions54",	"/powers_reset"
"ResetInstructions55",	"/powers_reset {primarySet} {firstPower} [secondary set]"
"ResetInstructions56",	"/powers_reset {primarySet} [first power] [secondary set]"
"ResetInstructions57",	"/powers_reset [primary set] [first power] {secondarySet}"
"ResetInstructions58",	"/powers_reset [primary set] [first power] [secondary set]"
"ResetInstructions59",	"Where [primary set] and [first power] are one of these pairs: (You might ask the player which one they want.)"
"ResetInstructions60",	"Where [first power] is one of:  (You might ask the player which one they want.)"
"ResetInstructions61",	"Where [secondary set] is one of: (You might ask the player which one they want.)"
"ResetInstructions62",	"* Extra Accolades power set."
"ResetInstructionsLong2",<<

3. Tell them to exit the game client all the way to the desktop and then log back in.
4. Tell them to go to trainer and train up.
5. Tell them to go to a store and buy back enhancements.
>>
"ResetInstructionsLong3",<<

Nothing seems too bad on this character.
They need to go to a trainer and train up, which should straighten them out.
If going to a trainer does not work, then their client may be confused.
Have them exit the game client all the way to the desktop and try again.
(Going back to login will NOT work.) If the problem persists after they have
logged back in, then you will need to file a report with Cryptic.
>>
"ResetInstructionsLong4",<<

This character was missing some of their inherent powers. They have already been re-added to the character.
Have the player check their power inventory and see if they are now present. If they are not, have them
exit the game client all the way to the desktop. (Going back to login will NOT work.)
If the problem persists after they have logged back in, then you will need to file a report with Cryptic.
>>
"ResetInstructionsLong5",<<

Nothing seems wrong on this character
Have the player check their power inventory and verify that the powers do not appear;
it is possible that the powers are merely missing from the tray. If this does not solve the issue,
Have them exit the game client all the way to the desktop. (Going back to login will NOT work.)
If the problem persists after they have logged back in, then you will need to file a report with Cryptic.
>>
"ResetInstructionsLong6",<<

This character has enhancements in slots where they don't belong.
You have two options:
1. You can remove ALL enhancements from this character and give them enough influence to buy back all those enhancements:
	/powers_cashin
2. You can give them the cost of the enhancements which are bad. The bad enhancements stay slotted, but they are of no use to the player and cause no harm.:"

"PSTankDesc",			"<p>- Good damage mitigation.</p><p>- Meant to soak up the majority of incoming attacks.</p><p>- Works well soloing or in teams.</p>"
"PSTankDescLong",		"The Tank playstyle likes to take a beating. It is designed around mitigating damage and having a large pool of Hit Points to rely on. While the damage output for the Tank Archetype is among the lowest of the Archetypes, it is made up for by their incredible survivability in the face of overwhelming odds."
"PSMeleeDesc",			"<p>- Good damage potential.</p><p>- Needs to be close to the target.</p><p>- Works well soloing.</p>"
"PSMeleeDescLong",		"The Melee Damage playstyle delivers a lot of damage, but is forced to put itself at considerable risk to do so. The archetypes of this playstyle have some of the higher damage outputs in the game, but trade that for more risky forms of damage mitigation. Their hope is that they take down their enemies before they get a lucky shot in."
"PSRangedDesc",			"<p>- Good damage potential.</p><p>- Can stand back from targets.</p><p>- Works well soloing.</p>"
"PSRangedDescLong",		"The Range Damage playstyle delivers a good amount of damage from relative safety: range. While most enemies have a ranged attack to attack back with, Range Damage characters can generally defeat them before they are at considerable risk. Any enemy that gets into melee range with you is a real threat and should be dealt with immediately."
"PSCrowdControlDesc",		"<p>- Prefers to lock down enemies.</p><p>- Works well in teams.</p><p>- Debuffs enemies when possible.</p>"
"PSCrowdControlDescLong",	"The Crowd Control playstyle finds its place in locking down enemies and debuffing them so that their attacks are not as frequent, miss more often, or do less damage. This is a "finesse" playstyle, and tends to play differently than ones that focus primarily on dealing damage. Control the enemies first, and you will have a far easier time taking down your opponents."
"PSSupportDesc",		"<p>- Has great buffing potential for teammates.</p><p>- Many power sets have healing capability.</p><p>- Works well in teams.</p>"
"PSSupportDescLong",		"The Support playstyle is key to the success of any teaming you will do. They can buff themselves and other characters with increases to health, defenses, damage, etc. In addition several support powersets have capability of healing both themselves and their allies, which comes in handy in larger and longer battles."
"PSPetsDesc",			"<p>- Damage output is augmented by the use of Pets.</p><p>- Many power sets have healing capability.</p><p>- Works well soloing or in teams.</p>"
"PSPetsDescLong",		"The Pets playstyle finds itself in control of several pets which do the bulk of the damage and damage mitigation of the character. Some Archetypes, like Controllers and Dominators, have no control over the actions of their pets, while the Mastermind can give orders to theirs, and have a variety of different types of pets out at one time."
"HeroIntroString",		"<p>- Start the game as any of the 10 basic Archetypes.</p><p>- Choose to play as a <font color=DodgerBlue><outline 1>HERO</outline></font> or <font color=DarkRed><outline 1>VILLAIN</outline></font> during the tutorial.</p><p>- <font color=DodgerBlue><outline 1>HEROES</outline></font> will continue play in Paragon City.</p><p>- <font color=DarkRed><outline 1>VILLAINS</outline></font> will continue play in the Rogue Isles.</p><p>- Play to level 50.</p>"
"HeroIntroStringLong",		"You will begin play in Galaxy City following a devastating meteor strike that leveled the area. Whether you decide to be a Hero or a Villain will be determined by a moral choice made shortly after you begin the effort of rescuing yourself. Heroes will find themselves based in Paragon City, saving the day from enemies such as the Hellions, Circle of Thorns, Clockwork King, and the 5th Column. Villains will operate out of the Rogue Isles, working their way up the Arachnos organization as a Destined One. There they will find opportunity and profit in taking on the forces of good such as Longbow, Wyvern, and the Goldbrickers."
"PraetoriaIntroString",		"<p>- Start the game as any of the 10 basic Archetypes.</p><p>- Choose to play as a RESISTANCE or LOYALIST during the tutorial.</p><p>- All characters will start play in Praetoria, an alternate dimension.</p><p>- Your character will be a Praetorian.</p><p>- You can leave Praetoria at level 20 for either Paragon City or the Rogue Isles.</p>"
"PraetoriaIntroStringLong",	"You will begin play in Praetoria as a newly recruited Loyalist of the Powers Division. On this alternate Earth, Emperor Cole personally overthrew the Hamidon monster saving the planet. Now he oversees the populace with the help of his trusted Praetors and his own personal army of super-powered beings. However not everyone sees Emperor Cole as benevolent. Some see him as a Tyrant, peeling back the veneer to reveal the corruption and mind-controlling methods he uses. These Resistance members are lead by Calvin Scott, using guerrilla tactics to attempt to bring down Emperor Cole and free Praetoria from his rule."
